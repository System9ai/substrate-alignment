"""Quantity / Cycle / ResourceKind + setpoints.

The three discriminators that make "what percentage is this, and what does it
mean" precise — the discipline that stops a band-shaped number being read as the
wrong band:

- **Quantity** — *what kind of band* a utilization reading lives in.
  ``RESISTANCE`` (a challenge held at the 1/3–1/φ² setpoint), ``WORK`` (the
  sustainable cruise in the work zone ≤ 0.50), ``GROWTH`` (φ-stepped transient
  peaks — NOT a sustained band; routed through growth-step assessment).
- **Cycle** — ``SHORT`` (latency / random / multitask — a TIGHT band, the
  queueing hockey-stick) vs ``LONG`` (throughput / sequential / focus — runs
  HOT). The same percentage means different things on each.
- **ResourceKind** — selects per-resource band defaults (CPU vs disk-capacity vs
  memory vs network), because a "protected reserve" and a hard-fail ceiling
  differ by resource.

``setpoint_for`` returns the ``(low, high)`` target band for a quantity from a
:class:`~substrate.executive.band.BandProfile`. Pure logic; the band module owns
the levels, this module owns the *meaning*.
